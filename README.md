The Tower of Hanoi

The standard form of the game involves three rods and a number of disks of different sizes that can be slid onto any rod. At the start of the game, all the disks are placed on one rod in ascending order with the smallest disk on top. The following diagram shows a tower of Hanoi with 6 disks in the starting position.
